== Prerequisites

=== Domains

The infrastructure provisioning requires one existing public hosted zone. In the following section it is described how you can add a domain which is registered at link:https://www.godaddy.com/[GoDaddy]. However, it works similar for any other domain registrar.

If you want you can also create a second public hosted zone (e.g. `letuscode.xyz`), though it is not required.

==== Create Route 53 Hosted Zone

1. Login to the link:https://eu-central-1.console.aws.amazon.com/console[AWS Management Console] and navigate to the link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/v2/hostedzones#[Route 53] service
2. Create a new `public hosted zone` for the first domain, (e.g. `letuscode.dev`)
3. Login to the link:https://account.godaddy.com/products[GoDaddy Management Console] and navigate to the DNS configuration of your domaine (e.g. `letuscode.dev`)
4. In the GoDaddy name server section set the the name servers displayed in the AWS Route53 hosted zone details overview 

===== Create Wildcard Certificate for Domain

1. Login to the link:https://eu-central-1.console.aws.amazon.com/console[AWS Management Console] and navigate to the link:https://eu-central-1.console.aws.amazon.com/acm[Certificate Manager] service
2. Request a new public certificate for the domain of the previously created hosted zone (e.g. `letuscode.dev`)
    a. Set the fully qualified domain name to `*.letuscode.dev` in order to create a wildcard certificate
    b. Set the validation method to `DNS validation`
3. Now you need to create a new CNAME in the previously created hosted zone with name and value shown in the certificate request. You can do this by clicking on the `Create records in Route 53` button in the certificate request page.
