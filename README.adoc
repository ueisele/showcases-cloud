== Prerequisites

=== Tools

Download and install the following tools:

* link:https://www.terraform.io/downloads[Terraform]
* link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html[AWS CLI]
* link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/[Kubectl]
* link:https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/[Helm]

Configure the tools:

.Create AWS Cli profile
[source,bash]
----
export SHOWCASE_AWS_PROFILE=tu-dev-ueisele
aws configure --profile ${SHOWCASE_AWS_PROFILE}
----

=== IAM Permissions

The required IAM permissions can be found in the individual directories.

* link:infrastructure/tfstate-s3/required-iam-policy.json[S3 Terraform State Backend Setup]
* link:infrastructure/vpc/required-iam-policy.json[VPC IAM Policy]
* link:infrastructure/eks/required-iam-policy.json[EKS IAM Policy]
* link:infrastructure/k8s-system/required-iam-policy.json[Kubernetes IAM Policy]

To capture the required policy, the tool link:https://github.com/iann0036/iamlive[iamlive] was used. How to use it together with terraform is describe in the blog article link:https://meirg.co.il/2021/04/23/determining-aws-iam-policies-according-to-terraform-and-aws-cli/[Determining AWS IAM Policies According To Terraform And AWS CLI].

Roughly summarized the following steps are required:

.Install iamlive
[source,bash]
----
go install github.com/iann0036/iamlive@latest
----

.Start iamlive in proxy mode
[source,bash]
----
iamlive \
    --profile ${SHOWCASE_AWS_PROFILE} \
    --mode proxy --bind-addr 0.0.0.0:10080 \
    --force-wildcard-resource \
    --output-file required-iam-policy.json
----

.Navigate to the terminal in which you want to run terraform and set the proxy env variables
[source,bash]
----
export HTTP_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:10080 \
       HTTPS_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:10080 \
       AWS_CA_BUNDLE="${HOME}/.iamlive/ca.pem"
----

.If you now run terraform apply, the required policy is recorded by iamlive
[source,bash]
----
terraform apply --var "profile=${SHOWCASE_AWS_PROFILE}"
----

== Next Steps

=== Kubernetes Authentication and Authorization:

* https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/kubernetes-rbac-and-iam-integration-in-amazon-eks-using-a-java-based-kubernetes-operator/
* https://github.com/rustrial/aws-eks-iam-auth-controller
* https://github.com/aws-samples/k8s-rbac-iam-java-operator/tree/master/java-operator

=== Security

* Security Groups for Pods: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/security-groups-for-pods.html
* Network Isolation with Calico: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/calico.html

=== Access

* VPN Server for secure access
* Public access for Confluent Platform

=== Resource Usage

* Evaluate Cluster Autoscaler and alternatives (see https://towardsdev.com/karpenter-vs-cluster-autoscaler-dd877b91629b). At the moment for example, even if Node Affinity perfers an ARM instance, an x64 instance is started.
* Autoscaling should remove replace an instance with a smaler type if possible.
